* Pending (short-term)

** Implement files sensibly

This will allow us to skip _lots_ of intermediate _files_ so it is
important, while we are opting more on the side of correctness than
efficiency.

Options for a file:

- block_data = upto N bytes stored in-place (I am tempted to keep this at
  smallish values, e.g. 100 bytes)

- single-block file = just one data block, no tree of blocks; up to maximum
  size of block (100k-ish?)

- tree of data blocks

** Consider if CBORPickler should also support e.g. IntEnum as argument

** Add missing functionality to forest module (e.g. remove API?)

** Write ops module so that it uses forest for heavy lifting

** Write more thorough filesystem tests to test_ops or elsewhere

*** readdir semantics

mutation should not result in non-mutated files being omitted/returned
twice (this should be trivially given we iterate automatically by
filename within the tree order?) 

* Pending (eventually)
