* Pending (short-term)

** Consider if CBORPickler should also support e.g. IntEnum as argument

** Add TYPE_FILENODE / TYPE_FILEDATA handling as well to forest module

TYPE_FILENODEs will represent large files (contains subtree of nodes with
blocks), and individual TYPE_FILEDATA represents small (= single
block-sized) files.

** Add reference counting to forest module

** Add missing functionality to forest module (e.g. remove API?)

** Write ops module so that it uses forest for heavy lifting

** Write more thorough filesystem tests to test_ops or elsewhere

*** readdir semantics

mutation should not result in non-mutated files being omitted/returned
twice (this should be trivially given we iterate automatically by
filename within the tree order?) 

* Pending (eventually)
